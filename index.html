            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Online teaching is here to stay. Many students prefer the online
                classroom since it
                offers flexibility in their busy schedules. With the proliferation of information and knowledge,
                students
                must become lifelong learners in today's world, and online education plays an important role in helping
                individuals access the learner-centered and self-directed instruction. With enhanced software, hardware,
                and
                Internet access, more options for online education will become available. With student enrollments
                increasing faster than classrooms can be built, students becoming more proficient with technology, and
                students pursuing an education that meets their needs, the future of online education will continue to
                grow.
                Online degree programs will become more widely accepted as they become a more common practice. The
                quantity
                of distance learning and online degrees in most disciplines is large and increasing rapidly. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The world is taken over by technology and one has to keep pace with
                these advancements in order not to lag back. Everything is available online these days and thus,
                education is also one of the most prevalent over the internet. However, the COVID-19 times have brought
                all the school and college classrooms to the internet as well. Online studies can be through textual
                content or through video lectures which is comparable to the books and classroom lectures. The main
                difference is the person’s physical whereabouts, i.e. while still staying at the same place, one can
                refer to online lectures from a person in another city/ state/ country. Online study is preferred
                because it saves time and doesn’t affect the pocket much. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">When we hear study without using ‘conventional’, the mind still goes
                with the teacher’s physical presence or books and notebooks. This is the mindset because we have all
                been brought up like this and so is the traditional education system in India until the world was forced
                to confine within the four walls of house. Books are said to be a person’s best friend as they don’t ask
                for any favour and give all that it has to offer, provided that the person is devoted enough to grab it
                all. When it comes to studies for semester exams or a particular assignment, or some sort of entrance
                exam, we all look forward for the best books by the top authors to study from. </p>
